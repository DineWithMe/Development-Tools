# README

Let me know if you want to update this repository.

No need to create branch for this repository, it serves as quick info, everyone can push it to master branch.

I recommend you commit this repository in your editor, it saves you from typing "br" tag.

This repository is not intended to be learning material (but will still add some), this repository list down the tools/libraries/frameworks used in this project and justification behind the decision.

## Library

When come to choosing the tools/libraries/frameworks, there is massive amount of options available. To avoid all sort of complexity, I adopt a simple and safe mindset when come in decision making.

Basically we use reputed and popular tools, because I believe they are more stable, more resourceful and higher chance of answering our technical problem.

Well it is not like I dont care about better technology, we will adopt better technology if they are proven to have clear advantages over existing and significant size of community.

Here is overview of what important library we are going to use in this project, of course it may change depend on need

Front End              | Library

UI Rendering           | React
Web Page Rendering     | Next
State Management       | Redux
UI Component Testing   | Enzyme
Test                   | Jest

Back End               | Library
---------------------- | -------------

Query Language         | GraphQL
Redis                  | Caching

## Editor

Recommendation on visual studio code extensions also available. Having a good editor is like having a good weapon, I strongly suggest you polish your weapon to ease your development process and enhance your development experience.

Unlike library, editor choice is very personal, use what fit you best.

## DevOps

We should cultivate devOps culture as soon as possible, from planning, building, testing, deployment, and monitoring, we will come up with suitable tool for every category and try to automate some of the process safely.


## Code Maintenance

We will also touch on coding philosophy and practice.
