# Development-Tools

Let me know if you want to maintenance this repository.

No need to create branch for this repository, it serves as knowledge base, everyone can push to master branch.

I recommend you commit this repository in your editor, it saves you from typing "br" tag.

## Library

This repository list down the tools/libraries/frameworks used in this project and justification behind the decision.

When come to choosing the tools/libraries/frameworks, there is massive amount of options available. To avoid all sort of complexity, I adopt a simple and safe mindset when come in decision making.

Basically we use reputed and popular tools, because I believe they are more stable, more resourceful and higher chance of answering our technical problem.

Well it is not like I dont care about better technology, we will adopt better technology if they are proven to have clear advantages over existing and significant size of community.

## Editor

Recommendation on visual studio code extensions also available. Having a good editor is like having a good weapon, I strongly suggest you polish your weapon to ease your development process and enhance your development experience.

Unlike library, editor choice is very personal, use what best fit you.

## Code Maintenance

We will also touch on coding philosophy and practice.
